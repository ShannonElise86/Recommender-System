# Recommender-System
A collaborative fillering method to give the best recommendations for luxury beauty products

## This project is split into two parts:

  Rating Exploratory Analysis: A closer look at the products and the reviews
  
  Recommender Pipeline and Results: Spark's 'Alternating Least Squares' pipeline is used to predict ratings for users and then a list of the top recommended products are generated.
